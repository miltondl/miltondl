# 👋 Hi, I’m Milton  

I’m a **Data Analyst** with a strong focus on automation, process optimization, and turning complex data workflows into clear insights.  

- ⚡ Skilled in **Python** (data pipelines, automation, APIs) and **SQL** (data modeling, analytics).  
- 📊 Experienced in building **dashboards and reports** that drive decisions (Google Sheets, Looker Studio, AppSheet).  
- 🔍 Comfortable working with **large datasets**, cleaning, structuring, and analyzing them to uncover patterns.  
- 🤝 Enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams and translating technical solutions into practical impact.  
- 🌱 Currently deepening my knowledge in **Machine Learning & Big Data**.

## 💼 Portfolio Projects  

Here are selected projects that highlight my skills in **data analysis, automation, and visualization**:  

- [🎯 Taggers Qualification](./taggers-qualification) – End-to-end evaluation pipeline: build a golden dataset, create controlled annotation tasks for taggers, and analyze performance (confusion matrices, per-label precision/recall, error reports).
- [📊 Automated Annotation Tracker](./Patch_Report_Automation) – Automates validation of annotation data, identifies taggers in Dataloop, and updates BigQuery tables to ensure data quality efficiently.  
- [✅ LabelCheck Validation](.github.com/miltondl/My_Projects/tree/main/labelcheck-validation) – Weekly proportional sampling with human-in-the-loop validation to measure and improve annotation accuracy.  
- [📈 Datapoints Usage Tracker](./datapoints-usage-tracker) – Tracks datapoints usage across projects/teams and visualizes results in Looker Studio.  
- [🌿 Weeds Tagging Coverage (SQL)](./weeds-tagging-coverage) – Advanced SQL analysis of weeds tagging coverage using tag counts and score metrics.
